# sandbox
An early alpha roguelike with an emphasis on sandbox elements.

# TODO
- Add settings file and logic to control said file.
- Hook settings logic to settings view
- Create play view and start working on map generation.
- Map Generators:
    - Port from my old python project:
        - simple room generator
        - cave generation based on cellular automata
    - Better room generator based on Wave Function Collapse ? 
    - Overworld ? - BIG Maybe!
